### Instructions

Your objective will be to **play back notes as fast as you can, without making mistakes**. If you make a mistake, you will need to repeat the line. Once you are able to play the line of notes without any mistakes, it will advance to the next line.

Once you are done playing all the lines of notes we give you, you will be given a code that you can enter below, answer a brief survey, and submit the HIT.
