<h3>Requirements</h3>

<p>Your computer must be able to <strong>play sound</strong>. <button onclick="testPlayNote(); return false">Click here</button> to test; you should hear a note. <audio id="testNote" src="//pianotutor.herokuapp.com/piano/Piano.ff.C4.m4a" style="display: none"></audio></p>

<h3>Instructions</h3>

<p>In this task, we will turn your keyboard into a musical instrument, by assigning notes to each of the keys.
